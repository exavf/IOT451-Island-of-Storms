**Island Project Idea 🌴**

I intend to model the Philippines as an island. Within this island, I wish to analyse both the frequency and the patterns of typhoons in the Philippines alongside other variables. By doing this, I hope to uncover trends, and perhaps test hypotheses and consequently draw meaningful conclusions from my dataset(s).

The Philippines sits in the Pacific Typhoon Belt, an area where storm formation is more prominent due to warm ocean waters further exacerbated by its close proximity to the equator. A third of the world's cyclones form here and approximately 20 tropical cyclones on average enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).  

As someone who has survived Super Typhoon Haiyan at age 7, which took over 10,000 lives in my hometown of Tacloban City in 2013, this project has great significance to me. Although having this personal subjective experience, this project will help me form an objective perspective through various typhoon data over the years. Additionally, I will try to implement my own forecasting models.

Typhoons, on average, cause an average annual loss of $3.5 billion every year according to the World Bank. Accurate forecasting models, as a result, are crucial to the safety of Philippine citizens and also its economy. This is because forecasts can help aid early warning systems, disaster prepareness, and risk modelling and insurance planning.

Variables I am currently considering: ENSO indicators (ONI, Niño3.4 SST), Western Pacific SST, Vertical wind shear, Mid-level humidity, Sea-level pressure, MJO phase, and Lagged typhoon counts. These will likely change (probably more variables) over the following days.
